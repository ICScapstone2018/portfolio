## Welcome to ICS Captsone 2018

Hello and welcome to our simple portfolio main page!

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### This is a little about us!

Our group consists of Kerensa Mattison, Jasmine Kivari, Zack Bowmann and Fiona Siu

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ICScapstone2018/portfolio/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
